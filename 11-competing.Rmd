Classical competing risks models will be discussed, as
well as their modern interpretations. The basic problem is that we want to
consider more than one type of event, but where exactly one will occur. For
instance, consider death in different causes. 

```{r compet11, fig.cap = "Competing risks: Causes of death.", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/compet.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```


The first problem is: How can the intensities
\begin{equation*}
\bigl(\alpha_1(t), \alpha_2(t), \alpha_3(t)\bigr), \quad t > 0
\end{equation*}
be nonparametrically estimated? It turns out that this is quite
simple. The trick is to take one cause at at time and estimate its
intensity as if the rest of the causes (events) are censorings. The real
problem starts when we want to have these intensities turned into probabilities.

## Some mathematics

First we need some strict definitions, so that the correct questions are
asked, and the correct answers are obtained.

The *cause-specific* cumulative hazard 
functions\index{cumulative hazard function} are
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma_k(t) = \int_0^t \alpha_k(s) ds, \quad t > 0, \quad k = 1, 2, 3.
\end{equation*}
The *total mortality* is
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\lambda(t) &= \sum_{k=1}^3 \alpha_k(t)\quad t > 0 \\
\Lambda(t) &= \sum_{k=1}^3 \Gamma_k(t), \quad t > 0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
and *total survival* is
\begin{equation*}
S(t) = \exp\left\{-\Lambda(t)\right\}
\end{equation*}
So far, this is not controversial. But asking for a "cause-specific survivor
function" is.

## Estimation


The quantities $\Gamma_k, \; k = 1, 2, 3$, $\Lambda$, and $S$ can be
estimated in the usual way.
$\Gamma_1$, the \emph{cumulative hazard function for cause 1} is
estimated by regarding all other causes (2 and 3) as censorings.
The total survivor function $S$ is estimated by the method of Kaplan-Meier,
regarding all causes as the same cause (just death).

Is it meaningful to estimate (calculate) $S_k(t) =
\exp\left\{-\Gamma_k(t)\right\}, \; k = 1, 2, 3$? The answer is "No". The
reason is that it is difficult to define what these probabilities mean in
the presence of other causes of death. For instance, what would happen if
one cause was eradicated?

## Meaningful probabilities

It *is* meaningful to estimate (and calculate)
\begin{equation*}
P_k(t) = \int_0^t S(s) \alpha_k(s) ds,\quad t > 0,\quad k = 1, 2, 3,
\end{equation*}
the probability to die from cause $k$ before time $t$.
Note that
\begin{equation*}
S(t) + P_1(t) + P_2(t) + P_3(t) = 1 \texttt{ for all  $t > 0$}.
\end{equation*}
Now, *estimation* is straightforward with the following estimators:
\begin{equation*}
\hat{P}_k(t) = \sum_{i:t_i \le t} \hat{S}(t_i-)\frac{d_i^{(k)}}{n_i}
\end{equation*}
See the function `comp` at the end of this chapter for how to write code for 
this estimation.

## Regression

It is also possible to include covariates in the estimating procedure.
\begin{equation*}
P_k(t) = 1 - \exp\left\{-\Gamma_k(t)\exp\left(X\beta^{(k)}\right)\right\}, \quad
t > 0, \quad k = 1, 2, 3.
\end{equation*}
These equations are estimated separately. In **R**, this can be done with the package
`cmprsk` [@figr99; @cmprsk11].

```{example name = "Mortality and emigration"}
```
People born in Skellefteå
  in northern Sweden around the year 1800 are followed over time from 15
  years of age
  to out-migration or death. Right censoring occurs for those who are still
  present on January 1, 1870. At exit the cause is noted, see
  Figure \@ref(fig:mortmig11).  

```{r mortmig11, fig.cap = "Mortality and emigration, Skellefteå, 1800--1870.", echo = FALSE}

The first rows of the data are shown in Table \@ref(tab:datah11).

```{r datah11, echo = FALSE}

zz <- readRDS("Data/zz.rds")
zz$birthdate <- toTime(zz$birthdate)
zz$event <- as.numeric(as.character(zz$event))

The variable `event` is coded as shown in Table \@ref(tab:comp11).

Without covariates we get the picture shown in Figure \@ref(fig:causespec10).
```{r nocomp9,fig=FALSE,echo=TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
source("R/comp.R")
comp(zz$enter, zz$exit, zz$event, start.age = 15)
```
-->

The code for the function `comp` is displayed at the end of this
chapter. It is not necessary to understand before reading on. It may be
useful as a template if you want to analyze competing risks.



```{r causespec11,fig=TRUE,height=6,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Cause-specific exit probabilities; mortality and migration from Skellefteå.", message = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
source("R/comp.R")
comp(zz$enter, zz$exit, zz$event, start.age = 15)
```

However, a simpler alternative is to use the function `survfit` in the `survival` package, see Figure \@ref(fig:survfit11), where the analysis is performed separately for men and women.

```{r survfit11, fig.cap = "Mortality and migration, Skellefteå 1820-1935."}
oldpar = par(mfrow = c(1, 2), las = 1)
library(survival)

fit <- survfit(Surv(exit, event) ~ 1, data = zz[zz$sex == "male", ], start.time = 15)
plot(fit, xlim = c(15, 50), col = 1:4, lty = 1:4, xlab = "Age",
     ylab = "Probability in state", lwd = 1.5, main = "Men", ylim = c(0, 0.25))
legend("topleft", legend = c("Dead", "Sweden", "Scandinavia", "Off Scandinavia"), 
       col = 1:4, lty = 1:4, bty = "n", lwd = 1.5, cex = 0.8)
abline(h = 0)
abline(h = 0.2, lty = 3)
fit <- survfit(Surv(exit, event) ~ 1, data = zz[zz$sex == "female", ])
plot(fit, xlim = c(15, 50), col = 1:4, lty = 1:4, xlab = "Age", 
     ylab = "Probability in state", lwd = 1.5, main = "Women", ylim = c(0, 0.25))
legend("topleft", legend = c("Dead", "Sweden", "Scandinavia", "Off Scandinavia"), 
       col = 1:4, lty = 1:4, bty = "n", lwd = 1.5, cex = 0.8)
abline(h = 0)
abline(h = 0.2, lty = 3)
par(oldpar)
```

Note that the survival is not explicitly shown in Figure \@ref(fig:survfit11), and the 
reason is that it is *redundant*, the sum of all probabilities at any fixed age in 
Figure \@ref(fig:causespec11) is equal to one (an individual must be in one and only one state 
at each age; note that "survival" really means "survived and still present in Skellefteå",
the state all start in at age 15).

And with covariates and `cmprsk`; the syntax to get it done is a little
bit nonstandard. Here *moving to other parish in Sweden* is analyzed
(`failcode = 2`).\index{Functions!\fun{crr}} See Table \@ref(tab:fakecrrout11).

```{r withcmprsk11, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(cmprsk)
xx <- model.matrix(~ sex + soc + illeg, zz)[, -1]
systim <- system.time(fit <- crr(zz$exit, zz$event, xx, failcode = 2))
summary(fit)
```

```{r fakecrrout11, echo = FALSE}
crrtab <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
crrtab[1, ] <- c(0.463, 1.59, 0.0223, 20.79, 0.0000)
crrtab[2, ] <- c(1.158, 3.18, 0.0596, 22.87, 0.0000)
crrtab[3, ] <- c(0.947, 2.58, 0.0679, 13.94, 0.0000)
crrtab[4, ] <- c(0.566, 1.76, 0.0229, 24.68, 0.0000)
crrtab[5, ] <- c(0.222, 1.25, 0.0487, 4.56, 0.0000)
rownames(crrtab) <- c("sex:female", "soc:official", "soc:business", "soc:worker", "Illegitimate")
colnames(crrtab) <- c("coef", "exp(coef)", "se(coef)", "z", "p-value")
tbl(crrtab, rownames = TRUE, caption = "Output from the function 'crr'.")
```

The *system time* for this call is one hour and 15 minutes.
The function `crr` is *very slow* with large data sets. Therefore I have refrained 
from calculating likelihood ratio *p*-values, so the ones in Table \@ref(tab:fakecrrout11)
are the *Wald* ones. However, it seems as if all covariates have a high explanatory value,
and we note that females move within Sweden more than men, and so do white collar people
compared to to the rest. Farmers are the most stationary ones, not surprisingly.
Maybe more surprising is the fact that people born outside marriage are more prone to migrate, 
at least within Sweden.


Note that this is *not* Cox regression\index{Cox regression} (but
close!). The corresponding Cox regression result is shown in 
Table \@ref(tab:withcox11).

```{r withcox11, comment = "", results = 'asis', echo = TRUE}
fit <- coxreg(Surv(enter, exit, event == "Sweden") ~ sex + soc + 
                  illeg, data = zz)
cap <- "Cox regression, moved to other parish in Sweden."
lab <- "withcox11"
fit.out(fit, caption = cap, label = lab)
```
\index{Functions!\fun{coxreg}}

As can be seen from Table \@ref(tab:withcox11), the same conclusions can be drawn 
with an ordinary Cox regression as with the competing risks approach, *in this case*, that is.


What about migrating to countries outside Scandinavia? The same covariates, but
stratified on `sex`, see Table \@ref(tab:withworldcox11) and Figure \@ref(fig:world11).

```{r withworldcox11, comment = "", results = 'asis'}
fit <- coxreg(Surv(enter, exit, event == "World") ~ strata(sex) + soc + illeg, data = zz)
cap <- "Competing risks by Cox regression and moved outside Scandinavia."
lab <- "withworldcox11"
fit.out(fit, caption = cap, label = lab)
```

Here illegitimacy does not mean much, but it is the *workers* that dominate migration 
in this case.

```{r world11, fig.cap = "Cumulative hazard functions for males and females, migration outside Scandinavia."}
plot(fit, xlab = "Age")
abline(h = 0)
```

Males end up with a double intensity of migrating, but the females start earlier.
