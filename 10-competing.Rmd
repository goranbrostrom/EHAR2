# Competing risks models

\index{competing risks|(}

Classical competing risks models will be discussed, as
well as their modern interpretations. The basic problem is that we want to
consider more than one type of event, but where exactly one will occur. For
instance, consider death in different causes.

The first problem is: How can the intensities
\begin{equation*}
\bigl(\alpha_1(t), \alpha_2(t), \alpha_3(t)\bigr), \quad t > 0
\end{equation*}
be nonparametrically estimated? It turns out that this is quite
simple. The trick is to take one cause at at time and estimate its
intensity as if the rest of the causes (events) are censorings. The real
problem starts when we want to have these intensities turned into probabilities.

## Some mathematics

First we need some strict definitions, so that the correct questions are
asked, and the correct answers are obtained.

The *cause-specific* cumulative hazard 
functions\index{cumulative hazard function} are
\begin{equation*}
\Gamma_k(t) = \int_0^t \alpha_k(s) ds, \quad t > 0, \quad k = 1, 2, 3.
\end{equation*}
The *total mortality* is
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\lambda(t) &= \sum_{k=1}^3 \alpha_k(t)\quad t > 0 \\
\Lambda(t) &= \sum_{k=1}^3 \Gamma_k(t), \quad t > 0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
and *total survival* is
\begin{equation*}
S(t) = \exp\left\{-\Lambda(t)\right\}
\end{equation*}
So far, this is not controversial. But asking for a "cause-specific survivor
function" is.

## Estimation


The quantities $\Gamma_k, \; k = 1, 2, 3$, $\Lambda$, and $S$ can be
estimated in the usual way.
$\Gamma_1$, the \emph{cumulative hazard function for cause 1} is
estimated by regarding all other causes (2 and 3) as censorings.
The total survivor function $S$ is estimated by the method of Kaplan-Meier,
regarding all causes as the same cause (just death).

Is it meaningful to estimate (calculate) $S_k(t) =
\exp\left\{-\Gamma_k(t)\right\}, \; k = 1, 2, 3$? The answer is "No". The
reason is that it is difficult to define what these probabilities mean in
the presence of other causes of death. For instance, what would happen if
one cause was eradicated?

## Meaningful probabilities

It *is* meaningful to estimate (and calculate)
\begin{equation*}
P_k(t) = \int_0^t S(s) \alpha_k(s) ds,\quad t > 0,\quad k = 1, 2, 3,
\end{equation*}
the probability to die from cause $k$ before time $t$.
Note that
\begin{equation*}
S(t) + P_1(t) + P_2(t) + P_3(t) = 1 \texttt{ for all  $t > 0$}.
\end{equation*}
Now, *estimation* is straightforward with the following estimators:
\begin{equation*}
\hat{P}_k(t) = \sum_{i:t_i \le t} \hat{S}(t_i-)\frac{d_i^{(k)}}{n_i}
\end{equation*}
See the function `comp` at the end of this chapter for how to write code for 
this estimation.

## Regression

It is also possible to include covariates in the estimating procedure.
\begin{equation*}
P_k(t) = 1 - \exp\left\{-\Gamma_k(t)\exp\left(X\beta^{(k)}\right)\right\}, \quad
t > 0, \quad k = 1, 2, 3.
\end{equation*}
These equations are estimated separately. In **R**, this can be done with the package
`cmprsk` [@figr99; @cmprsk11].

```{example name = "Mortality and emigration"}
```
People born in Skellefte책
  in northern Sweden around the year 1800 are followed over time from 15
  years of age
  to out-migration or death. Right censoring occurs for those who are still
  present on January 1, 1870. At exit the cause is noted, see
  Figure \@ref(fig:mortmig10).  

```{r mortmig10, fig.cap = "Mortality and emigration, Skellefte책, 1800--1870.", echo = FALSE}
plot(1, 1, xlim = c(0, 30), ylim = c(0, 20), type = "n", axes = FALSE,
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

        add = TRUE)

The data at hand looks like this:
```{r datah10, echo = FALSE}
load("zz.RData")
head(zz)
```

A summary:

```{r tabzz10, echo = FALSE}
summary(zz[, -(1:3)])
table(zz$event)
```

The variable `event` is coded as shown in Table \@ref(tab:comp10).

```{r comp10, echo = FALSE}
x <- data.frame(Code = c(0, 1, 3, 4, 5), Meaning = c("Censored", "Dead", "Moved to other parish in Sweden",
                                        "Moved to other Scandinavian country",
                                        "Moved outside tha Scandinavian countries"),
                Frequency = c(10543, 2102, 4097, 59, 464))

Without covariates we get the picture shown in Figure \@ref(fig:causespec10).
```{r nocomp9,fig=FALSE,echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}
source("comp.R")
comp(zz$enter, zz$exit, zz$event, start.age = 15)
```
-->
The code for the function `comp` is displayed at the end of this
chapter. It is not necessary to understand before reading on. It may be
useful as a template for those who wants to analyze competing risks.

```{r causespec10,fig=TRUE,height=6,echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Cause-specific exit probabilities; mortality and migration from Skellefte책.", message = FALSE}
source("comp.R")
comp(zz$enter, zz$exit, zz$event, start.age = 15)
```

And with covariates and `cmprsk`; the syntax to get it done is a little
bit nonstandard. Here *moving to other parish in Sweden* is analysed
(`failcode = 3`).\index{Functions!\fun{crr}}
```{r withcmprsk10}
library(cmprsk)
xx <- model.matrix(~ -1 + parity, zz)
fit <- crr(zz$exit, zz$event, xx, failcode = 3)
fit
```

Note that this is *not* Cox regression\index{Cox regression} (but
close!). The corresponding Cox regression is
