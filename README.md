# Event History Analysis with R, Second Edition

This is the beginning of the Second Edition of the
Chapman and Hall book "Event History Analysis with R" from 2012.
A preliminary release date of the paper book was set to September 2019, but due to unforeseen 
circumstances, there has been a significant delay. The project is now moving forward again.

The html version of the Second Edition as it looks today is found [here](http://capa.ddb.umu.se/EHAR2/).

Suggestions and comments are welcome!
