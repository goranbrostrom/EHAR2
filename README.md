# Event History Analysis with R, Second Edition

This is the beginning of the Second Edition of the
Chapman and Hall book "Event History Analysis with R" from 2012.
A preliminary release date of the paper book is September 2019.

The html version of the Second Edition as it looks today (not so much so
far) is found [here](http://capa.ddb.umu.se/EHAR2/).

**Note 2019-01-30:** Due to unforeseen circumstances, my work on the book
has had a long break until now, but it will be over very soon.

Suggestions and comments are still welcome!
