The first edition of this book was published in 2012, nine years ago. Since then
the field of event history and survival analysis has grown and developed rapidly, 
both in terms of available scientific data and
of software development for analyzing data, not the least in the **R** environment.
We have also seen public need of analyzing what is going on around the world, and the 
present (2021) state of the COVID-19 pandemic is a striking example of that.

So the time for a second edition of the book is now. The basic chapters on Cox regression 
and proportional hazards modeling are much the same as in the first edition, but they 
have been updated. There are two new chapters, Chapter 4, *Explanatory Variables and Regression*,
and Chapter 7, *Register-Based Survival Data Models*. Compared to the first edition, 
chapters have been reordered so that the logical flow is clearer. On the other hand, 
the appendices C and D are somewhat shorter now because there are a lot of excellent sources 
on-line today covering their topic, which anyway is a little bit off here.  

Since the publication of the first edition in 2012, focus has gradually shifted towards 
the analysis of large and huge data sets, where Cox 
regression favorably can be replaced by parametric proportional hazards models with
piecewise constant baseline hazard hazard functions. With huge data sets with 
excessively many events, this way of tabulating data leads to a significant reduction of
necessary efforts in producing reliable results with the same precision and power a full
analysis would have had. This result relies on reduction by the mathematical *sufficiency 
principle*, all irrelevant (so defined by the model) noise is eliminated. A word of 
warning is that this noise (*residuals*) may be relevant in *model evaluation*.

A second point of importance is how to present results from a regression analysis,
and especially how to present estimated *p*-values. Two important issues in this area
are (i) present only *relevant* ones, and (ii) make sure they are of the right kind, 
that is, *likelihood ratio based*.  This important topic is addressed in the book,
and supported by new summary functions in the **R** package `eha` [@eha].

The writing of this book has been done in parallel with the development of the **R** package
`eha`. Almost all the data sets used in the examples in this book are available in `eha`, 
so you can easily play around with them on your own. Some data sets will also be published 
on the home page of the package, http://ehar.se/r/eha/.

I had, as usual, invaluable support from the publisher, CRC Press, Ltd. I
especially want to thank Vaishali Singh and Rob Calver for their interest in my
work and their encouragement in the project. 

The first edition of the book was written in *LaTeX* with support of the **R** package 
`Sweave`, but with the second edition we decided to do the writing in Rmarkdown 
using the **R** packages `bookdown` and `knitr`. The reason was mainly that it allowed for
the production of output in both *HTML* (for the website) and *PDF* (the printed book).
I am indepted to Yihui Xie for his important work in this area, which made this 
approach possible.

Adding to the list of people who gave 
valuable input to the First Edition of the book: Kristian Hindberg and Glenn Sandström
have contributed with suggestions that have improved the text in this Second Edition.
Many thanks goes to Elisabeth Engberg, director of the Centre for Demographic and 
Ageing Research (CEDAR),
Umeå University, for letting me use the facilities that made this work possible.

This book is about the analysis of event history and survival data, with
special emphasis on how to do it in the statistical computing environment
R [@cran]. The main applications in mind are
demography and epidemiology, but also other applications, where durations
are of primary interest, fit in to this framework.
Ideally, the reader has a first
course in statistics, but some necessary basics may be found in Appendix A.
The basis for this book is courses in event history and survival analysis
that I have given and developed over the years since the mid-eighties, and
the development of software for the analysis of this kind of data. This
development has during the last ten to fifteen years taken place in the
environment of R  in the package **eha** [@eha].

There are already several good text books in the field of survival and event
history analysis on the market,
 @abg08, @abgk93,
@coxoakes84, @ph00,
@kp02, and @jl03 to mention a few. Some of these are already
classical, but they all are aimed at an audience with solid mathematical
and statistical background. On the other hand, the  @pm95,
@pa84, @pasas95,
@km03,
@collett, and
@ejj99 books are all more basic but lack the special treatment
demographic applications needs today, and also the connection to **R**.

In the late seventies, large databases with individual life histories began
to appear. One of the
absolutely first was *The Demographic Data Base* (DDB) at Umeå
University. I started working there as a researcher in 1980, and at that
time the data base contained individual data for seven Swedish
parishes scattered all over the country. Statistical software for Cox
regression [@cox72] did not exist at that time, so we began a
development, with the handling of large data sets in mind, of Fortran
programs for analyzing censored survival data. The starting point was Appendix 3 of
@kp80. It contained "Fortran programs for the proportional hazards
model".

The beginning of the eighties was also important because then the first
text books on survival analysis
began to appear. Of special importance (for me) was the books by
@kp80, and, four years later, @coxoakes84.

The time period covered by the DDB data is approximately the 19th
century. Today the geographical content is expanded to cover four large
regions, with more than 60 parishes in total.

This book is closely tied to the _R Environment for Statistics and
Computing_ [@cran]. This fact has one specific advantage: Software and
this book can be totally synchronized, not only by adapting the book to the
software, but also vice versa. This is possible because R and its packages
are *open source*, and one of the survival analysis packages [@eha]
in R and this book have the author in common. The `eha` package
contains some research results not found in other software
[@brli08; @gb02; @gb87]. However, it is important to emphasize that the real
work horse in survival analysis in R is the recommended package `survival`
[@survival].

The mathematical and
statistical theory underlying the content of this book is exposed to a
minimum; the main target audience is social
science researchers and students who are interested in studying
demographically oriented research questions.
However, the apparent limitation to demographic applications in this book is not
really a limitation, because the methods
described here are equally useful whenever durations are of primary
interest, for instance in epidemiology and econometrics.

In Chapter 1 event history and survival data are exemplified, and the
specific problems data of this kind poses on the statistical analysis.
Of special importance are the concepts of censoring and truncation, or in
other words, incomplete observations. The dynamic nature of this kind of
data is emphasized. The data sets used throughout the book are presented
here for the first time.

How to analyze homogeneous data is discussed in Chapter 2. The concept of a
survival distribution is introduced, including the hazard function, which is
the fundamental concept in survival analysis. The functions that can be
derived from the hazard function, the survival and the cumulative hazard
functions, are introduced. Then the methods for estimating the fundamental
functions non-parametrically are introduced, most important the
Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators. By "nonparametric" is meant
that in the estimation procedures, no restrictions are put on the class of
allowed distributions, except that it must consist of distributions on the
positive real line; a life length cannot
be negative. Some effort is put into giving an understanding of the
intuitive reasoning behind the estimators, and the goal is to show that the
ideas are really simple and elementary.

Cox regression is introduced in Chapter 3 and expanded on in Chapter 5. It
is based on the property of proportional hazards, which makes it possible
to analyze the effects of covariates on survival without specifying a
family of survival distributions. Cox regression is in this sense a
non-parametric method, but correct is perhaps to call it semi-parametric,
because the proportionality constant is parametrically determined. The
introduction to Cox regression goes via the log-rank test, which can be
regarded as a special case of Cox regression.A fairly detailed discussion of
different kinds of covariates are given, together with an explanation of
how to interpret regression parameters connected to these
covariates. Discrete time versions of the proportional hazards assumption
is introduced.

In Chapter 4, a break from Cox regression is taken, and Poisson regression
is introduced. The real purpose of this, however, is to show the equivalence
(in some sense) between Poisson and Cox regression. For tabular data, the
proportional hazards model can be fitted via Poisson regression. This is
also true for the continuous time piecewise constant hazards model, which
is explored in more detail in Chapter 6.

The Cox regression thread is taken up again in Chapter 5. Time-varying
and so-called communal covariates are introduced, and it is
shown how to prepare a data set for these possibilities. The important
distinction between internal and external covariates is
discussed. Stratification as a tool to handle non-proportionality is
introduced. How to check model assumptions, in particular the proportional
hazards one, is discussed, and finally some less common features, like
sampling of risk sets and fixed study period,  are introduced.

Chapter 6 introduces fully parametric survival models. They come in three
flavors, proportional hazards, accelerated failure time, and discrete time
models. The parametric proportional hazards models have the advantages
compared to Cox regression that the estimation of the baseline hazard
function comes for free. This is also part of the drawback with parametric
models; they are nice to work with but often too rigid to fit data from
a complex reality. It is for instance not possible to find simple
parametric descriptions of human mortality over the full life span, it
would require a
U-shaped hazard function, and no standard survival distribution has that
property. However,
when studying shorter segments of human life span, very good fits may be
achieved with parametric models. So is for instance old age mortality, say
above the age of 60, possible to model accurately with the Gompertz
distribution. Another important general feature of parametric models is
that they convey a a simple and clear message of the properties of a
distribution or relation, thus easily adds to the accumulated knowledge
about the phenomenon it is related to.

The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is an alternative to the
proportional hazards (PH) one. While in the PH model, relative effects are
assumed to remain constant over time, the AFT model allows for effects
to shrink towards zero with age. This is sometimes a more realistic
scenario, for instance in a medical application, where a specific treatment
may have an instant, but transient effect.

With modern register data, exact event times are often not
available. Instead data are grouped in one-year intervals. This is
generally not because exact information is missing at the government
agencies, but a result of integrity considerations. With access to birth
date information, a person may be easy to identify. Anyway, as a result age
is only possible to measure in (completed) years, and heavily tied data
sets will be the result. That opens up for the use of discrete-time models,
similar to logistic and Poisson regression. In fact, as is shown in
Chapter 4, there is a close relation between Cox regression and binary and
count data regression models.

Finally, in the framework of Chapter 6 and parametric models, it is
important to mention the piecewise constant hazard (PCH) model. It
constitutes an excellent compromise between the non-parametric Cox
regression and the fully parametric models discussed above. Formally, it is
a fully parametric model, but it is easy to adapt to given data by changing
the number of cut points (and by that the number of unknown parameters).
The PCH model is especially useful in demographic and epidemiological
applications where there is a huge amount of data available, often in
tabular form.

Chapters 1--6 are suitable for an introductory course in survival analysis,
with a focus on Cox regression and independent observations. In the
remaining chapters, various extensions to the basic model are discussed.

In
Chapter 7, a simple dependence structure is introduced, the so-called
shared frailty model. Here it is assumed that data are grouped into
clusters or litters, and that individuals within a cluster share a common
risk. In demographic applications the clusters are biological families,
people from the same geographical area, and so on. This pattern creates
dependency structures in the data, which are necessary to consider in order
to avoid biased results.

Competing risks models are introduced in Chapter 8. Here the simple
survival model is extended to the inclusion of failures of several
types. In a mortality study it may be deaths in different causes. The common
feature in these situations is that to each individual, many events may
occur, but at most one will occur. The events are competing with each
other, and at the end there is only one winner. It turns out that in these
situations the concept of cause-specific hazards is meaningful, while the
discussion of cause-specific survival functions is problematic.

During the last few decades, causality has become a hot topic in
statistics. In Chapter 9 a review of parts relevant to event history
analysis are given. The concept of matching is emphasized. It is also an
important technique of its own, not necessarily tied to causal inference.

There are four appendices. They contain material that is not
necessary to read in order to be able to follow the core of the book, given
proper background knowledge. Browsing through Appendix A is recommended to
all readers, at least so that common statistical terminology is agreed
upon. Appendix B contains a description of relevant statistical
distributions in R, and also a presentation of the modeling behind the
parametric models in the R package **eha**. The latter part
is not necessary for the understanding of the rest of the book. For readers
new to R, Appendix C is a good starting point, but it is recommended to
complement it with one of many introductory text books on R or on-line
sources. Consult the [home of R](https://www.r-project.org)
and search under *Documentation*. Appendix C also contains a separate
section
with a selection of useful functions from the **eha** and the
**survival** packages. This is of course recommended reading for
everyone. It is also valuable as a reference library to functions used in
the examples of the book. They are not always documented in the text.

Finally, Appendix D contains a short description of the most important
packages for event history analysis in R.

As a general reading instruction, the following is recommended. Install the
latest version of R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and
replicate the examples in the book by yourself. You need to install the
package **eha** and load it. All the data in the examples are then
available on line in R.

Many thanks go to people who have read early and not so early versions of
the book; they include Tommy Bengtsson, Kristina Broström, Bendix
Carstensen, Renzo Derosas, Sören
Edvinsson, Kajsa Fröjd, Ingrid Svensson, and students at the
Departments of Statistics and Mathematical Statistics at the University of
Umeå. Many errors have been spotted and improvements suggested, ant the
remaining errors and weaknesses are solely my responsibility.

I also had invaluable support from the publisher, CRC Press, Ltd. I
especially want to thank Sarah Morris and Rob Calver for their interest in my
work and their thrust in the project.

Of course, without the excellent work of the R community, especially the
R Core Team, a title like the present one had been impossible. Especially
I want to thank Terry Therneau for his inspiring work on the
**survival** package; the **eha** package depends strongly on it.
Also, Friedrich Leisch, author of the **Sweave** package, deserves many
thanks. This book was entirely written with the aid of the package
**Sweave** and the typesetting system *LaTeX*, wonderful companions.

Finally, I want to thank Tommy Bengtsson, director of the \emph{Centre for
Economic Demography}, Lund University, and Anders Brändström, director
of the Demographic Data Base at Umeå University,
for kindly letting me use
real data in this book and in the R package **eha**. It greatly
enhances the value of the illustrations and examples.
